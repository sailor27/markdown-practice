# Black Lives Matter Donation Drive
### August 1-31

I’m pretty excited about the Black Lives Matter Fundraiser, and I am grateful to all the people who put work into it so far. I think we have the opportunity to raise a lot of money for our local Black Lives Matter chapter, if we all make sure to talk to people at the register about it.

I realize we have a lot of stuff to talk to people about at the register. I also realize that simply asking people if they would like to round up their purchase for Black Lives Matter may send certain customers into a mode where they subject you to attestations of their conscious or unconscious racism *(more about this at end of email). However, I want to say that getting people to donate is _REALLY EASY_ and letting every customer know that we stand with Black Lives Matter is **REALLY IMPORTANT**.

### Easy? How so? Well, here are the directions:

**HOW TO RING IT UP:**

* If they're rounding up their purchase, grab a calculator and figure out how many cents = the next dollar amount ($5 - $4.36 = $.64 donation
* Enter donation amount into POS
* Press "general donation" button
* It's in! Continue ringing them up as usual.

I tell people their total, then immediately after say:

 _“Would you like to round up to \[amt of their total rounded up to next dollar\] for Black Lives Matter?”._

That’s all I say. It works!!!

People like even-numbered totals. Plus, you save time not making change on cash transactions, so it helps you as well!

I kept track of how many donations I got reg-ing for about 1.5 hrs during my breaks shift. I got 18! In total today, we have raised $115 so far. We can do better than this if we all make sure to ask every transaction! Plus, these conversations could lead to people getting interested and involved in supporting BLM in other ways! Hand out fliers!

* Getting donations at the reg is a breeze, but having conversations with customers about racism and police violence definitely is not. Call for support if you need another person, or just to get out of there. Also, remember that you can say no to continuing a conversation. I haven’t had to do this yet, but I have been thinking that if I need someone to stop telling me their racist opinion, I might try “I’m sorry, but I can’t continue having this conversation. Thanks. Have a good day.” Interrupting their racist opinions with thought-provoking statements is a great thing to do if you can, but if you can’t, sending them on their way is OK!”  Boundaries are kind! Boundaries are important!

Thanks again everyone who put the donation drive together.
